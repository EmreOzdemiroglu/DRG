"""
Functional tests for extraction - test actual functionality, not just mocks.

These tests verify that the extraction pipeline actually works correctly:
- Entity extraction from text
- Relation extraction from text
- Cross-chunk relationship discovery
- Schema generation
- Entity resolution
- Coreference resolution
- Negation detection
- Temporal information extraction
- Confidence scores
- Reverse relations

These tests may require API keys (marked with @pytest.mark.integration).
